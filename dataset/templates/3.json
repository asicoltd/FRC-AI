        "frc_materiality_conclusion": "Based on both quantitative and qualitative factors, multiple material misstatements and non-compliance issues have been identified. The quantitative threshold of BDT 124m is significantly exceeded by the estimated impact of aggressive revenue recognition (up to BDT 2,500m) and the value of undisclosed/non-compliant transactions. Qualitatively, the governance failures, fraud risks, and going concern issues are inherently material as they fundamentally undermine the reliability of the financial statements and the entity's sustainability. Therefore, the financial statements contain material departures from IFRS and relevant regulations.",
        "reason_of_the_status": "The aggregation of quantitative misstatements (particularly in revenue and related party transactions) far exceeds the quantitative materiality threshold. More importantly, the qualitative factors—especially governance failure, fraud risk, and going concern doubts—are so severe that they would influence the economic decisions of users regardless of the exact monetary amount. These issues affect the financial statements as a whole.",
