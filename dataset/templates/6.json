        "reason_of_the_status": "The ratio analysis reveals a company in financial distress: deteriorating liquidity (low & falling current/quick ratios), dangerously high and increasing leverage (D/E of 3.36), and poor asset efficiency. Earnings quality is low, evidenced by a high and spiking accruals ratio and a growing gap between revenue and cash collection. The vertical analysis shows a capital structure overly reliant on debt and a worrying increase in receivables as a percentage of assets.",
