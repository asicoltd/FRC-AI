It suffers from a critical liquidity crunch (very low quick ratio), severe inefficiencies in working capital management (bloated receivables and inventory), and dangerously high and increasing leverage. Profitability metrics are weakening and are propped up by unsustainable debt. The aggregate of these ratios supports the earlier findings of high fraud risk, aggressive accounting, and compromised going concern sustainability over the medium term."
