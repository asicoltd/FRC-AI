Revenue grew by 15% (from BDT 10,870m to BDT 12,500m), while cash collected from customers (approximated from change in receivables and revenue) grew by only 8%. This growing gap indicates sales are increasingly made on credit or revenue is recognized ahead of cash receipt.",

The combination of a high and spiking accruals ratio, divergence between revenue growth and cash collection, and aggressive judgments on revenue timing presents a high risk that reported revenue and earnings are of low quality and may not be sustainable or realizable."
