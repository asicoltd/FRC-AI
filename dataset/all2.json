Qualitatively, the governance failures, fraud risks, and going concern issues are inherently material as they fundamentally undermine the reliability of the financial statements and the entity's sustainability. Therefore, the financial statements contain material departures from IFRS and relevant regulations.",

These issues affect the financial statements as a whole.",
